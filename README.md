## Hi there 👋. I'm Oleksii, an iOS developer.

I like SwiftUI and its API a lot, so much that I build a DesignSystem for a client with a passion. This passion has kept me exploring the topic for a few years. My teammates got excited about it too. So we ended up exploring with theming and tokens.

Here is what we have in public:

### Design System & Tokens
- [SnappTheming](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappTheming) - A comprehensive SwiftUI design system with theming capabilities
- [SnappDesignTokens](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappDesignTokens) - Design tokens in Swift-understandable format

### Developer Tools
- [swift-coverage-action](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/swift-coverage-action) - GitHub Marketplace action for automated Swift test coverage reporting with PR comments and quality gates
- [SwiftFormatLintPlugin](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SwiftFormatLintPlugin) - SPM plugin for swift-format linting and auto-formatting, with Xcode support

I'm also a runner - helps me to keep my mind clear and keeps my Strava active.
