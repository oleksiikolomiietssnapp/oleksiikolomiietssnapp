## Hi there 👋. I'm Oleksii, an iOS developer.

I like SwiftUI and its API a lot, so much that I build a DesignSystem for a client with a passion. This passion has kept me exploring the topic for a few years. My teammates got excited about it too. So we ended up exploring with theming and tokens.

Here is what we have in public:

### Design System & Tokens
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappTheming/main/Sources/SnappTheming/SnappTheming.docc/Resources/logo%402x.png" height="24"> [SnappTheming](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappTheming) - A comprehensive SwiftUI design system with theming capabilities
  - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappThemingSVGSupport/main/Sources/SnappThemingSVGSupport/SnappThemingSVGSupport.docc/Resources/logo_svg.png" height="24"> [SnappThemingSVGSupport](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappThemingSVGSupport) - enables support for SVG asset handling in SnappTheming
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappDesignTokens/main/Sources/SnappDesignTokens/SnappDesignTokens.docc/Resources/logo.png" height="24"> [SnappDesignTokens](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappDesignTokens) - Design tokens in Swift-understandable format

### Developer Tools
- [swift-coverage-action](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/swift-coverage-action) - GitHub Marketplace action for automated Swift test coverage reporting with PR comments and quality gates
- [SwiftFormatLintPlugin](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SwiftFormatLintPlugin) - SPM plugin for swift-format linting and auto-formatting, with Xcode support

I'm also a runner - helps me to keep my mind clear and keeps my Strava active.
