## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Oleksii, an iOS developer.

I like SwiftUI and its API a lot, so much that I build a DesignSystem for a client with a passion. This passion has kept me exploring the topic for a few years. My teammates got excited about it too. So we ended up exploring with theming and tokens..

Here is what we have in public: 
- [SnappTheming](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappTheming) - check it out.
- [SnappDesignTokens](https://github.com/Snapp-Mobile/SnappDesignTokens) - tokens into swift-understand formatt.

I'm also a runner - helps me to keep my mind clear and keeps my Strava active.
